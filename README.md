# Machine-Learning-Projects
This repository contains some of my first projects on machine learning, using python for a programming language.

These small projects were made so that i may understand the basics of ML, while also containing the  "common approach" for different types of problems,
such as linear regression using a linear regressor or a Sequential model, classification, image classification, etc.
